# Remembrall

People often struggle remembering their thoughts. Twitter may be a solution for
some of them, but it lacks the option of hiding your personal ideas for only
yourself and sharing some others with the rest of the world. When someone
shares a personal thought with others it often causes controversy depending on
who had the thought or the comments that might be harmful or direct. Here is
where “Remembrall” comes in to help.
